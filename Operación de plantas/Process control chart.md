p-Chart

Measures proportions and controls them. Assumes binomial distribution of errors
Only pass-fail inspections

UCL  y LCL igules
$\hat{\sigma}_p=\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}{N}}$


## Concepts: 
 - Upper control limit
	 - Higher value which can be achieved by process (not always desirable)
	 - Calculated as: $UCL = \bar{\bar{x}}+z\sigma_{\bar{x}}$, where $\sigma_{\bar{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}$, the deviation of means $\bar{x}$ and $z$ is the number of standard deviations within control.
 - Lower control limit
